# personal_projects
## Here is some of my personal projects:
- **Havashenasi**: Hardware of a climate monitoring system based on IOT. This system can be used with **light sensor**, **temperature and humidity sensor** and any other sensors which are based on **Modbus** interface.
- **climCtrl**: Hardware of a climate control system with many ooptions: 
  - 14 isolated outputs.
  - voltage and current outpus sensors.
  - Modbus interfaces for sensors and etc.
  - STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller.
  - Delta HMI interface.
  - reserved inputs and outputs.
